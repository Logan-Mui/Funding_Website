# Funding_Website

This was a school project that I worked on in a team of 5. 
The goal was to create a fully furbished website that resonates the same functionality as a kickstarter or gofundme. 
"Needs", the funding goals of the website were modified and retrieved using HTTP requests in the API that we created. 

There is a design document included, so please take a look for further details.
